# According to National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER), 
# the relationship between the noisiest floor and distance from road has following correlation:
# Noisiest floor = 0.2467 * Distance from road + 4.159
# Find the noisiest floor in integer form.
# Assume the Distance from road is: 12m.

print(int((0.2467 * 12) + 4.159))
